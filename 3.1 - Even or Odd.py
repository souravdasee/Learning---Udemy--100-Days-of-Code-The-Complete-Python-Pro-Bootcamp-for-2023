#Code_Challenge

#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Hint<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
# All even numbers can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
# Try some using the modulo with some odd numbers e.g.
# 3 % 2
# 5 % 2
# 7 % 2
# Then try using the modulo with some even numbers e.g.
# 4 % 2
# 6 % 2
# 8 % 2
# See what's in common each time.
